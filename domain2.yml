      What is captial, pursuing capital, Sales management, Sales pipeline
      
      The subject of how to raise financing for a business is always on the minds of new business owners. While money does not grow on trees, there are several options for obtaining finance for your company.

      The development of a sales force, coordination of sales operations, and implementation of techniques for a commercial drone business to hit and exceed sales targets are the three key focal points within sales management, entailing the development of a sales force, coordination of sales operations, and implementation of techniques for a commercial drone business to hit and surpass sales targets.

      Business owners should be completely aware of multiple costs such as staff, equipment, maintenance, insurance, compliance, taxes, and licensing in order to determine capital investment requirements, providing time for adequate and sensible planning.

      Managing Capital Resources
      
      Having the best tools When going on a project, having the proper equipment is critical to delivering consistent results and providing a product that meets the customer's expectations.

      The logistics surrounding specific applications sought by a commercial drone firm will influence prices, particularly if specialist equipment is required, such as the type or number of drones needed to execute a task.

      For sustained airworthiness, commercial drones require routine preventative maintenance, servicing, and inspection, which should be performed by certified and trained experts.

      Pursuing Capital, Working Capital, Equity Capital etc.
      
      Capital is typically cash or liquid assets held or obtained for expenditures, for providing ongoing production of goods and services for creating profit or used as investment to create value for a firm

      Working capital measures a company's short-term liquidity—more specifically, its ability to cover its debts, accounts payable, and other obligations that are due within one year.

      Private equity is not raised in the public markets and instead, it usually comes from a select group of investors or owners.

      Sources include financial institutions, online lenders, credit card companies, insurance companies, along with federal and state lending programs.

      Drone equipment, UAV sensors, Personnel requirements, Primary roles, A real-life example, MRO

      Drones are more formally known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or unmanned aircraft systems (UASes). Essentially, a drone is a flying robot that can be remotely controlled or fly autonomously through software-controlled flight plans in their embedded systems, working in conjunction with onboard sensors and GPS.

      Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul, or MRO, usually refers to FAA and manufacturer prescribed maintenance repair activities of various types and complexities. Here we will touch upon each of the processes that comprise MRO, as well as understanding insurance and liability.

      special drone sensors
      
      Active sensors are well active. They emit some type of wave or radiation.

      Passive sensors detect waves or radiation, receiving information as it is detected in the natural world. The main examples are eyes and ears

      LiDAR, or Light Detection and Ranging, technology resembles its sister technology, radar. But instead of emitting and analyzing radio waves, it produces and measures rapid laser pulses.

      Thermal sensors are able to accurately measure surface temperatures. Every object gives off a heat signature, and thermal sensors are able to translate that signal into a false color optical image

      It is important to keep in mind that as mission complexity increases, so does personnel requirements, and that a business focused on videography for social events has very different personnel requirements compared to one that conducts offshore platform inspections.
      
      The main roles generally employed by UAV service providers include:Owner, Pilot-in-Command, Operator, Visual observer, Sensor specialist etc.

      The owner could be a purchaser of the UAV or the overall UAV Operation, the LLC. The owner could also serve in other roles such as the Pilot in Command (PIC) and be an owner operator of the commercial drone business. The owner could also serve in an auxiliary crew capacity.

      The operator, who is a member of the auxiliary crew, may take control of the UAV under the direct supervision of the certified PIC. They must be well versed in the flight control of various UAV models and be briefed in detail on the planned flight path.

      A Visual Observer or VO is an optional crew member who serves as a second set of eyes, monitoring the drone during flight to provide support to the Pilot-in-Command. The Visual Observer must be able to see the UAV throughout the entirety of the mission and must always be in direct communication with both the PIC and operator.

      A sensor specialist is an operator who is trained to manipulate the sensor payloads that are required to execute mission objectives. Considering the wide set of applications that UAVs are now being deployed for, sometimes multiple specialists will be required for more complex solutions.

      Facilities: Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO)

      In aviation, the term Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) traditionally refers to FAA certified maintenance repair stations, with strict adherence to established federal regulations which govern their service, under 14 CFR Part 145.

      While Part 107.15 requires the remote PIC to ensure that the UAV is in condition for safe flight, both prior to and during its operation, it does not provide structured procedures by which to accomplish this.

      There may be components of a UAV that are identified by the manufacturer to undergo scheduled periodic maintenance or replacement based on time-in-service limits, such as flight hours, cycles, and calendar days.

      In our endeavor to model our AD ecosystem in alignment with aviation industry standards, we are taking established steps towards applying aviation-grade MRO practices to AD’s product line.
      
      When a loaner aircraft is provided, the liability associated with the AD-owned loaner drone transfers automatically to the client once the loaner is paired to the AD Cloud.

      As missions get complex, so do the tools. Optimizing the right aircraft and sensors to an application use case is critical when planning for a drone mission.

      Active sensors emit some form of radiation or sound, and then detect the reflected signals. Examples include LiDAR, radar and sonar.

      Drones depend on specialized sensors like LiDAR, thermal, multi-spectral and spectroscopic instruments to inspect assets, analyze natural environments and gather scientific data.

      Hyperspectral sensors go deeper and are capable of creating three-dimensional imagery, such as within the forestry industry where UAVs are able to identify the exact species of certain trees.

      UAS providers must correctly identify the human resource requirements that will guarantee the successful implementation of client services, whether it be on-field or in the office.

      An operator can serve as a member of the auxiliary crew and may operate the controls of the UAV under the direct supervision of a certified Pilot in Command.

      Communications, External versus internal, Marketing 101, Promotional mix, Marketing budget

      Communication is essential to the success of any business and the process of transferring information from one person to another within and outside the business environment

      A communications plan provides a clear path forward, guiding where and how to place resources and efforts.

      Even though internal and external communications activities may be different, both systems have similar goals and need to be aligned when delivering messages to employees, customers and other stakeholders.

      For a company’s success, it’s imperative that internal and external communications plans work together and are as complimentary as possible.

      The best promotional options for your business will depend on your target audience and what is the most cost-effective way to reach as many as possible and as many times as possible.
