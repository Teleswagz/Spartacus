  utter_fttf_benefits:
  - text: |
      Flight to the Future (FF) is a real opportunity for you to take control of your income. 

      At the end of the six week program, you will be fully licensed, trained how to maximize the AD Cloud, own your own limited liability company (LLC), and be fully onboarded to accept jobs through the world's first Drone on Demand app.

      AD packed tremendous value into the FF program:
      · $5,000 of training and services for $999.
      · Work on your schedule.
      · No need to slowly build and nurture a customer base.

      · The very real potential to earn a six-figure income working part time.
      · No further investment! All costs such as drone financing will be deducted as you earn.

      · No commitment. If life changes down the road you still have your own LLC and your commercial drone license. You own both! You are under no obligation to purchase AD products at the end of the program.

      Once you complete all four steps, you can download the Drone on Demand App, which is modeled similarly to that of UBER or Lyft where you will be connected through the app to job opportunities in your area.

      Financing is also available at this point and will depend greatly on the sensor package that you require.
  utter_fttf_kit:
  - text: |+
      This kit contains all the four steps needed to train, gain expertise and begin your drone operations. 

      We start with step 1 – ground training tailored for the FAA certification written exam. With a robust online curriculum, the course is designed for those with no drone or aviation experience. You'll get to really start using your AD Cloud account at this point. 

      The second step consists of an introduction to AD Cloud – a specialized cloud for UAV operations with edge computing and built-in analytics. Using a rich, interactive online educational experience model called Mind Expanding Journey, you'll learn about the Command and Control capabilities that the powerful AD Cloud has for drone operations. The Flight to Future dashboard will keep track of your progress. An artificial intelligence, Spartacus, will advise you throughout.

      Step three is a Mind Expanding Journey into a commercial solution. Once you select your preference, for example 'perimeter security', we'll serve you a Journey tailored for the application, so you can gain both ground and simulator experience specific to an industry. This is the step that transforms you into a professional drone expert.

      Finally, step four is the most significant step towards entrepreneurship. AD will provide a turn-key business configuration by registering your business, providing free insurance for one year and no-cost financing for your hardware and equipment lease. We'll also maintain and service the drones so you always have the best equipment in the field. When you begin business operations, the AD Cloud dashboard will send drone job opportunities through its drone-on-demand service and integrate with the Command and Control module to set up your drone missions with proper FAA authorizations.

      Flight to the Future or F2F is an advanced drone training program focused on all the steps required to become a highly capable UAS service provider. 

      Along with an online simulator and business set up support, F2F takes you from basic education and FAA Part 107 certification, to owning your own drone business

      AD's Command and Control, or simply AD C2, is where you are able to plan and deploy multiple drone missions simultaneously. 

      With an advanced map-based interface for setting up operation details, and an automatic system for obtaining any necessary FAA approvals, 
      C2 is a one-stop-shop platform for executing safe, reliable and compliant drone flights.

      Finally, we have Aquiline's drone-on-demand service, known as ADoD, which will be launched in the summer of 2021. 

      The purpose of ADoD is to connect potential clients with drone operators, providing a real-time job board that is available to our Flight to the Future graduates and select UAS providers.

        Welcome to Flight to the Future.

        This educational platform is divided into four steps, containing 36 modules.

        The core modules each have seven segments: introduction, presentation, concept, in-depth, recap, reading list and assessment. You will progress serially through the program as you complete each segment, in the initial phase. Once you obtain your Part 107 license, you can jump to any lesson without the need for serial progression.

        Both the presentation and concept segment for each module can be viewed either in text or video format, allowing you to learn in a way that suits your personal preference.

        Step 1 is training and certification, where you will obtain a solid understanding of key UAV concepts, that are part of the official FAA study guide for the Part 107 examination. Includes topics such as the physics of flight, weather theory and FAA regulatory details.

        Step 2 is all about cloud technologies and how they are reshaping the UAV industry. Concepts such as AI and the Internet of Things will be discussed, and participants will start using the AD cloud and its C2 service platform to plan, set up and execute mock drone missions. 

        Step 3 delves into mastering a solution, where we take a deep look into specific commercial UAV applications and the special skills required in each. There are many industry applications for UAVs and we'll examine a number of them across several 'super-categories' such as asset inspection, surveying, security and so on.

        Step 4 is about your drone business, where we go into details about how to set up, structure, operate and market your UAV business in a professional and efficient manner, with risk management and FAA compliance.

        Drone systems

        What are drones? From multi-rotors to fixed-wing, drones come in many shapes and sizes. 
        In this lesson you'll learn how drones are made, what their vital components are, and the engineering that makes it all possible.

        With emphasis on multi-rotors, you'll get a good understanding of the vital systems and technologies employed.
        For additional perspective, delve into the history of drones and discover how this technological marvel evolved.

        In this module, you will gain insight into how AD drones are transforming commercial drone operations using advanced technologies that allow for increased autonomy, automated mission planning, compliance, and management. 

        In automated mission planning, for instance, the rapid gathering and definition of mission parameters result in the optimization of workloads, achieving solution repeatability. 

        You'll learn how UAV systems are engineered, with a focus on both air and ground segments. You'll gain an understanding of how mission considerations play a crucial role in determining engineering details. 

        As you'll see in this module, drone engineering is fairly simple to start with but becomes more complex as you specialize in real-world situations.

        A brief history of drones will also be presented in this module, giving you a deeper context on how technologies have evolved over the years and how some game-changing discoveries led to the development of UAVs as we know them today. 

        By the end of this module, you will have gained valuable knowledge on how drone systems work and will be ready to study the science behind drone flight.

        Aerodynamics

        The laws of physics that govern the flight of every drone are introduced in this module. 

        Understand the forces involved, and the efforts to counter them in flight. With treatments for both multi-rotor and fixed-wing configurations, you'll learn about the conditions that enable a drone to stay airborne. 

        Going beyond the basics, get a glimpse of the future of drone flight, which is autonomous, enabled by developing sophisticated algorithms for flight control.

        In this module, we will look into the laws of physics which are relevant to drone flight, with emphasis on the concept of vectors and how it can be used to understand the forces acting on a drone. 

        You will also learn how the interplay of forces such as gravity and lift, along with aerodynamic laws and the conservation of angular momentum makes drone flight possible. 

        We will then move on to study the specifics of how drones fly, focusing on how different parts of a multi-rotor are designed to overcome forces like gravity and execute flight commands. 

        From the engineering behind UAVs to the different maneuvers that can happen during a mission, we will understand how intelligent design and basic principles of aerodynamics, forces, and angular momentum, along with a power source, enable drones to fly.

        Lastly, we will look at how control theory, a framework for controlling dynamical variables in any engineered device, is applied to UAVs, allowing for capabilities such as autonomous flight and drone swarms. 

        By the end of this module, you have attained valuable knowledge on aerodynamics and will be ready to study UAV performance.

        Performance

        Like for manned aircraft, drone performance can be defined in ways that are measurable. A number of factors affect performance. In this module, you'll see how atmospheric and weather conditions can influence drone flights. 

        High performance drones exist in a variety of categories. From racing drones, to autonomously controlled swarms, discover some of the cutting-edge efforts that are being made to improve capabilities.

        In this module, we will gather an understanding of how the atmosphere can influence aerial operations and safety.  As we know, adverse weather can hamper or even ground aerial operations, 

        therefore it is imperative to the safety of UAV missions to be able to recognize the impact atmospheric and weather conditions have on drone operations.

        We will dive further into atmospheric stability, clouds, and thunderstorm lifecycles, which are important atmospheric processes that all mission planners need to be on the lookout for. 
        You will attain insight into the different stages of thunderstorm cycles, as well as the effects they can have on UAVs, thus preparing you to become a safe UAS provider. 

        Last but not least, we will look into autonomous light swarms, which are also known as drone light shows. These consist of UAVs equipped with LEDs that are flown in a formation to create moving, illuminated, synchronized, and choreographed images in the sky.

        By the end of this module, you will have attained valuable knowledge on drone performance and will be ready to study weight and balance.
  utter_step1_1_5:

        Weight and balance

        All aircraft have weight and balance restrictions. Drones are no exception. In order to safely operate drones, you'll need to understand the ways in which weight and balance affect flight and the procedures to achieve stability. 

        Payloads play a crucial role and you'll learn how to properly follow loading rules based on the drone capability. You'll also get a closer look at some heavy-lift UAV configurations that are being pioneered for cargo and passengers.

        Here you will learn about how the weight distribution on the drone affects its center of gravity, which, in turn, affects the craft's balance while in flight. Both weight distribution and balance are critical to flight performance. 

        Optimizing a drone's balance, by considering how the position of the battery, camera, and other payloads will affect the position of the center of gravity is crucial for achieving ideal results. 

        We will also approach how a multi-rotor drone is properly loaded for flight and how it is the pilot-in-command's responsibility of examining the payload to determine how the center of gravity will shift.

        As aerial vehicles, drones are subject to the laws of physics. Engineering and design define vehicle capability. 

        And usually, drones are designed keeping the mission in mind. So how does a drone manufacturer come up with a design that's worthy of production.

        Although subject to the same laws of physics, there are significant differences in the aerodynamics and flight characteristics of these two types of aircraft.
        
        By examining the forces acting upon the vehicle, you'll learn engineers arrive at the basic parameters that are needed for successful and stable flight.

        As a future commercial drone operator, you have to become extremely familiar with flight controls and the terminology behind the various actions a pilot-in-command (PIC) can take. 

        With its origins in marine operations, you'll be shown the definitions of pitching, rolling and yawing - and how they are achieved by varying the power delivered to the propellers on a multi-rotor.

        We'll start with forces and the laws of motions. This will provide the background for understanding weight, lift and thrust. 

        In physics, the unit of force is the Newton, named after the famous English scientist Sir Isaac Newton. Some of the other forces drones encounter are lift, air drag and thrust. 

        Newton’s first law of motion states that every object stays at rest or in uniform motion unless acted upon by an external force.
        
        Uniform motion means movement with constant velocity, or in other words, motion with a constant speed and direction. 

        This definition is a representation of Newton’s second law of motion. This force is always present on objects with mass and it tends to keep them on the ground.

        To overcome this, a drone generates lift or thrust. Fixed wing and multi-rotor drones generate lift differently, so let’s look at how they do it. 

        For fixed wing configurations, thrust or forward motion is usually generated using a piston or jet engine to burn fuel and expel it from the back exhaust.

        Newton’s third law of motion states that to every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Hence, the vehicle is propelled forward. 

  utter_step1_3_3:

        Drones now have embedded electronics and computers that process data in real-time.

        They also drive other specialized sensors that can detect movement, acceleration, wind speed, air pressure and so on.

        So let’s examine how a drone takes off. Power is supplied to the batteries through the regulator-distributor. 
        
        The power is rotating the blades, which pushes the air underneath, opposing the force of gravity. 

        As we saw earlier, the flight controller card interprets the land command signal from the transceiver and instructs the regulator to lower power to the drone motors.

        To pitch forward, the drone will reduce power to its two front motors, while increasing power to the two back motors. 

        To pitch backwards, the drone will reverse the whole process, increasing power to the front motors, while reducing power to the back motors.

        As we’ll see later, the pitch motion is integral for producing forward thrust in multi-rotors.

        Control theory is a framework for controlling dynamical variables in any engineered device.
        
        It’s been around since antiquity, often being used in hydraulic projects where fluid control is needed.

        A centrifugal governor or speed regulator is a type of device that employs a feedback loop to control the flow of fluid or fuel at a near-constant speed in an engineered device.

        Wing flutter is a dynamical instability arising from the interplay of aerodynamic, elastic and inertial forces. A control system is needed to counter it and ensure airframe stability.

        A drone swarm allows for a task to be distributed across a number of vehicles with little or no operator intervention. This configuration is poised to disrupt the UAV industry.

        The core operating principle here, is the ability to sense-and-avoid. If drones can ‘see’ each other and dynamically adjust flight paths to avoid collisions, complex operations can take place in an automated fashion. For instance, disaster relief in the aftermath of a hurricane.

        Although subject to the same laws of physics, there are significant differences in the aerodynamics and flight characteristics of fixed wing drones, relative to multi-rotors.

        Fixed wing drones generate lift by exploiting the difference in air pressure and velocity, above and below the surface of an airfoil, which in turn, is uniquely designed for this effect.

        Multi-rotor drones have individual motors that drive each propellor. No matter the type of design, they all achieve flight by spinning their propellor blades, which pushes the air down.

        To understand the forces acting on a drone, whether at rest or in flight, we have to use the concept of vectors. A vector is anything that has both magnitude and direction. All forces are vectors.

        The forces on a drone in flight, namely gravity, which defines the weight, along with lift, thrust and air drag – can be understood using Newton’s laws of motion. 

        Newton’s first law of motion states that every object stays at rest or in uniform motion unless acted upon by an external force. Uniform motion means movement with constant speed and direction.

        The second law states that the net acceleration of any object is proportional to the net force experienced by the object and inversely proportional to the mass of the object.
        
        The third law states that to every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This can be used to understand lift and thrust in drones.

        Like for manned aircraft, drone performance can be defined in ways that are measurable. A number of factors affect performance.

        In this lesson, you’ll see how atmospheric and weather conditions can influence drone flights. 

  utter_step1_4_1:
    - text: |+
        Performance factors are those related to a drone's ability to fly, and they are many. 

        Speed, rate of climb, cloud ceiling, payload capacity, range, maneuverability and stability are but some that come into play when evaluating how well a drone will respond during flight and also what limits must be placed upon flight execution.

        Atmospheric conditions are vital to a drone's flying capabilities and should not be underestimated in importance. Any experienced pilot will tell you about the extreme challenges and high risks that adverse conditions present.

        A precise knowledge regarding the technical aspects of atmospheric stability is essential for all aerial pilots.

        In this part of the video, we will learn how vertical air movements, associated with atmospheric instability, can lead to considerable flight hazards such as turbulence, compromised visibility or even unexpected crashes.

  utter_step1_4_2:
    - text: |+
        Performance is used to describe the ability of any aircraft to accomplish certain goals.

        The capabilities most affected by performance are takeoff and landing distance, rate of climb, ceiling, payload capacity, range of operations, speed, maneuverability, stability and fuel consumption.

        Most crucial amongst these, is the climb performance of an aircraft. Payload weight, weather conditions and altitude affect thrust and power. Weight, especially, has a pronounced effect on an aircraft. As weight is added, the aircraft has to fly a higher angle of attack for a given altitude and speed. 

        The International Standard Atmosphere or ISA is a standard which establishes a baseline atmospheric profile, that is used to measure aircraft performance. 

        A useful parameter in describing aircraft performance in a non-standard atmosphere, is density altitude. This is the altitude in the standard atmosphere corresponding to a certain value of air density.

        For a given pressure, as temperature is increased, air expands, which decreases density. The converse is true when temperature is decreased. So, the density of air varies inversely with temperature.

  utter_step1_4_3:
    - text: |+
        The stability of the atmosphere depends on its ability to resist vertical motion. A stable atmosphere makes vertical movement difficult, and small vertical disturbances dampen out and disappear. 

        The combination of moisture and temperature determine the stability of the air and the resulting weather. 

        Cool, dry air is very stable and resists vertical movement, which leads to good and generally clear weather. 

        As air rises and expands in the atmosphere, the temperature decreases. There is an atmospheric anomaly that can occur due to convective process, where the reverse is true.

        As we saw earlier, the relationship between dew point and temperature defines the concept of relative humidity. The dew point, given in degrees, is the temperature at which the air can hold no more moisture.
        
        When the temperature of the air is reduced to the dew point, the air is completely saturated.

        Specialized software allows users to select light show patterns and special effects, then place them in a timeline, similar to those found in video editing software.
        
        The software then calculates the flight path for each drone, guaranteeing they don’t collide in the air. 

        Digital barriers, known as geofences, are used to prevent drones from straying away from the safe-flight zone.

        At the same time, drones in a swarm utilize multiple radio frequencies, to ensure communications are always maintained during flight. 

        Only a few dozen companies worldwide have the combination of hardware, software and skills necessary to pull off professional-grade shows. 

        Drone light shows were tremendously expensive at first, but production costs have decreased over time.

        Light swarms are becoming more mainstream as the technology matures, highlighting the potential business opportunity for commercial drone operators.

        Adverse weather can hamper or even ground aerial operations.

        The capabilities most affected in performance are takeoff and landing distance, rate of climb, ceiling, payload capacity, range of operations, speed, maneuverability, stability and fuel consumption. 

        A useful parameter in describing aircraft performance in a non-standard atmosphere, is density altitude. This is the altitude in the standard atmosphere corresponding to a certain value of air density.

        A decrease in air density means a higher density altitude, while an increase in air density means a lower density altitude. Aircraft performance decreases as density altitude increases.

        Air density is affected by changes in altitude, due to pressure, along with changes in temperature and humidity. If air pressure increases, it compresses the air in a lesser volume, thus increasing air density.

        For a given pressure, as temperature is increased, air expands, which decreases density. And since water vapor is lighter than air, moist air is lighter than dry air.

        All aircraft have weight and balance restrictions. Drones are no exception. In order to safely operates drones, you’ll need to understand the ways in which weight and balance affect flight and the procedures to achieve stability.

        Payloads play a crucial role and you’ll learn how to properly follow loading rules based on the drone capability. You’ll also get a closer look at some heavy-lift UAV configurations that are being pioneered for cargo and passengers.

        As we have discussed before, the laws of physics govern flight, and the concept of center of gravity is no exception.

        Understanding what it is, how it is determined, what role a drone's pilot has in verifying compliance with manufacturer guidelines and what adjustments are possible, is a must for anyone who wishes to succeed in drone operations.

        Optimizing the weight distribution on a drone is fundamental in attaining desired performance, as a suboptimal weight distribution can result in a significant decline in maneuverability and controllability.

        Rotational mass is a concept in physics that describes the intensity of the force that is needed to counteract the inertia of any object undergoing a rotational movement. By the same token, it is also the force necessary to initiate the rotational movement of a stationary object.

  utter_step1_5_2:
    - text: |+
        The key issue around drone balance is regarding the drone's center of gravity - knowing where it is and how its position will affect flight performance. 

        The center of gravity is the exact point where the drone's weight is concentrated. If the drone was supported at its precise center of gravity, it would balance perfectly, at any attitude. 

        The position of the center of gravity has a great bearing upon flight stability, and the allowable location of the center of gravity is determined by manufacturers in accordance with the design of each particular drone. This is done by taking into consideration how the so-called center of thrust, the point where the force of lift occurs, will shift during flight.

        The battery may be placed on the superior or inferior part of the frame, resulting in a significant impact on the exact position of the center of gravity.

        Installing the battery on the bottom part of the drone will, in general, pull the center of gravity to below the plane of the propeller discs. 

        This will result in an oblique angle between the center of gravity and the plane of the propeller discs, which is not ideal for flight performance. 

        Structurally speaking, it is better to have the battery on the bottom of the drone's frame as it is in a more protected location, and in the case of a crash or collision, the inertia of the battery's weight will not put more force on the drone's frame. 

        This minimizes damage to the drone due to physical impact.

  utter_step1_5_3:
    - text: |+
        Without loss of generality, we’ll consider how a multi-rotor drone is properly loaded for flight. The pilot-in-command will examine the payload and determine how the center of gravity will shift. 

        The center weight is composed of the battery and the payload. It is ideal to have both as close together as possible. As we saw earlier, industry practice leans towards placing the battery on top, counterbalancing it with the sensor payload at the bottom.

        The spacing between the two needs to be very tight, as any gap between them will produce a less concentrated center of gravity, resulting in the drone's motors having to work harder when climbing or maneuvering.

        Thus, for optimal flight performance it is desired to have the battery and payload packed as tightly together as possible, providing the best distribution of weight along the Z, or vertical axis.

        Heavy lift drones are typically able to carry a payload of over ten pounds, with top-of-the-line models capable of transporting in excess of 400 pounds.

        They have the ability to carry various types of cargo and generally employ gas powered or hybrid engines. This makes them ideally suited for emergency response and life-critical delivery services.

        Until recently aerial transportation of heavy loads could only be done by manned aircraft, such as planes and helicopters. However, the modern development of heavy lift drones opens up a whole new world of possibilities.

        With heavy lift drones, cargo may now be hauled by unmanned craft, thus eliminating risk factors to human pilots and allowing the delivery of payloads in hazardous areas.

        Heavy lift drones pose a higher danger to people on the ground and other aircraft in the skies, in regard to potential collisions and catastrophic failures. 

        Motor redundancy is a critical feature. Generally, quadcopters are not utilized unless there are double motors on each arm, making it capable of smoothly landing in the event of a motor failure.

  utter_step1_5_5:

        Before any flight, the pilot-in-command must verify that the weight and balance conditions of the drone are in accordance with the restrictions established by the drone's manufacturer.

        The weight distribution on the drone affects its center of gravity, which, in turn, affects the craft's balance while in flight. Both weight distribution and balance are critical to flight performance.

        The center of gravity is the exact point where the drone's weight is concentrated. The so-called center of thrust, is the point where the force of lift occurs. When the two coincide, the drone is completely stable.

        As the drone maneuvers in flight, the center of thrust shifts. Manufacturers design their craft keeping into consideration the proximity of the two centers. The closer they are, the better it is for stability.

        The optimal position for the center of gravity on a drone's vertical, or Z, axis, is for it to be as close as possible in relation to the plane of the propeller discs or motors. 

        By using vectors to analyze the forces involved, we can deduce that this results in an equilibrium that is more stable – and a drone that is more responsive in flight.

        Aeronautical decision-making or ADM is the mental process used by pilots to determine the best course of action in an aviation environment. ADM skills are crucial for operating aircraft in a safe and responsible manner. 

        In this lesson, you’ll learn best practices and ADM procedures to ensure good risk management for drone operations. For greater context, explore the history of ADM and learn how pilots get trained in this evolving arena.

        Throughout the execution of a flight plan, a pilot will make countless decisions. Being able to do this without committing any errors is no small feat.

        The science of the human decision-making process is of great interest to the field of aviation, having applications in all areas of operation.

        Understanding how flight operators should interpret contextual information, and what best practices exist to enhance performance, is an essential step towards entering the profession.

        When in flight, pilots must constantly be aware of a vast array of information, know where their focus must be placed, what critical factors are to be monitored and what possible actions may be executed to eliminate or mitigate risk.

        The continuous process of identification, evaluation and execution is a cycle in which a pilot is constantly looping through, moving from factor to factor in a procedural and efficient manner. 

        Developing individual or group capabilities for each of the three stages of risk management, those being identification, evaluation and execution, is the final goal of all ADM tools.

  utter_step1_6_2:

        Aeronautical Decision Making, or ADM, is a systematic approach to the mental process used by pilots to consistently determine the best course of action in response to a given set of circumstances.

        It is what a pilot intends to do based on the latest information he or she has. 

        As a pilot, the importance of developing effective decision-making skills cannot be overemphasized. 

        While progress is continuously being made in many areas, such as advanced training methods, modernized equipment and improved systems, accidents do occur.

        When we look into the causes behind aerial accidents there is one commonality that is predominant: the human factor. Studies have repeatedly shown that over seventy percent of all aviation accidents are caused by human error.

        Considering this, the emphasis of aviation training in regard to decision-making has shifted from a physical task-based approach to a more risk management and human-factors-based approach, seeking to address the main cause of errors in flight.

        Declaring a pilot fit to fly depends on more than just their physical condition. Personal attitudes can easily affect a person's ability to make good decisions, especially in a short frame of time or in an emergency.

        We define attitude as being a motivational predisposition to respond to people, situations or events in a given manner.

        Extensive studies have been able to identify five specific hazardous attitudes that can interfere with the ability to properly exercise authority, those being: anti-authority, impulsivity, invulnerability, macho, and resignation. Think of them as mental “red flags”.  

        After identification, the pilot must state the observed hazardous attitude and its corresponding antidote, or tool, proven to mitigate the risk factor. Antidotes must be memorized, so that they immediately and automatically come to mind, when needed.

        Therefore, let’s take a closer look at the five hazardous attitudes, and elaborate on the antidote for each.

        Training in various decision-making tools is key towards becoming a skilled pilot. Let's look into five practical frameworks that pilots can use to achieve more efficient and thorough decision-making capabilities.

        They are the 5P and 3P models, using PAVE, CARE and TEAM checklists. Then there is also the DECIDE model.

        What are the 5 Ps?

        They are: Plan, Plane, Pilot, Passengers, and Programming. The pilot must identify and review all critical variables for each P. In regard to drone deployment, we consider team members in the place of passengers.

        This method relies on the pilot having a risk-management approach to decision making, rather than a reactionary one.

        The Federal Aviation Administration or FAA is a government agency that falls under the US Department of Transportation and is responsible for the safety of all civilian aviation in the United States. 

        In this lesson you’ll learn about the important role the FAA plays in commercial drone operations and the services, regulations and partnerships they have in place to facilitate the expansion of the UAV industry.

        The modern age of powered flight began in 1903 when Orville Wright made the first sustained, powered flight on December 17 in a plane he and his brother Wilbur built.

        As a result, the early 20th century witnessed myriad aviation developments as new planes and technologies entered service. During World War I, the airplane also proved its effectiveness as a military tool and, with the advent of early airmail service, showed great promise for commercial applications.

        Early aviation remained a dangerous business. Flying conditions proved difficult since the only navigation devices available to most pilots were magnetic compasses so pilots flew 200 to 500 feet above the ground so they could navigate by roads and railways.

        Low visibility and night landings were made using bonfires on the field as lighting. Fatal accidents were routine.

        The Air Mail Act of 1925 facilitated the creation of the profitable commercial airline industry, and airline companies began scheduled commercial passenger service.

        By the mid-1930s, the four major domestic airlines that dominated commercial travel for most of the 20th century began operations: United, American, Eastern, and Transcontinental and Western Air (TWA).

        The UAS Integration Office, also referred to as AUS, is responsible for leading the FAA's work in safely integrating unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) into the National Airspace System (NAS). AUS serves as the FAA's one-stop-shop for all matters related to civil and public use of unmanned aircrafts in U.S. airspace. 

        Currently, the AUS is organized into four divisions plus an executive office, that together champion UAS integration activities by engaging various stakeholders. Let’s look into the executive office and each division in more detail.

        The Executive Office, also referred to as AUS-10, is the hub that connects the four AUS Divisions with the Director and the Deputy Director and supports outward-facing opportunities of the AUS organization. Day-to-day activities include agency-level meeting support as well as responding to media inquiries, Congressional requests, and miscellaneous requests. 

        They also coordinate enterprise-wide outreach and engagement efforts, such as the FAA UAS Symposium, Drone Safety Awareness Week, the Drone Advisory Committee and online content in general. This office shapes UAS integration and innovation efforts, pertaining both to FAA accomplishments and stakeholder impacts.

        The Business and Planning Division, also referred to as AUS-100 is responsible for obtaining and preserving the financial and human capital management required to accomplish the office’s mission. 

        This division ensures AUS staff have a safe and productive work environment and executes the all strategic planning activities for the AUS, such as tactical performance management and Congressionally mandated milestone tracking.

        To fly your drone under the FAA's Small UAS Rule, referred to as part 107, you must obtain a Remote Pilot Certificate from the FAA. This certificate demonstrates that you understand the regulations, operating requirements, and procedures for safely flying drones.

        There are different rules for pilots who are already certificated by the FAA under Part 61. Student pilots and first-time pilots must follow a different procedure.

        Here we will cover both situations, for existing pilots and for first-time pilot certification.

        The eligibility requirements are that they must hold a pilot certificate issued under 14 CFR part 61 and must also have completed a flight review within the previous 24 months.

        The certificate must always be easily accessible by the remote pilot during all UAS operations and it is valid for 2 years.
        
        After this period, certificate holders must pass a recurrent knowledge test to renew their certificate.

        The FAA forecasts the Small UAS (sUAS) model fleet will likely more than double in size over the next five years, from the present 1.1 million units to over 2.4 million units.

        This is in great part due to the social desire for enhanced connectivity and promoting the economic vibrancy of remote and rural locations within the United States. 

        For an example of potential growth rates, we can look at the data for 2018, where the FAA registered 277,000 unmanned aircraft. This number was a staggering 80% above the FAA forecast for that year.

        The FAA’s “low,” “base” and “high” forecast scenarios for until 2022 are 17%, 25%, and 36% annual growth rates, respectively.

        Consumer-grade versus professional-grade

        Consumer-grade drones currently hold a 95% market share, which is expected to drop to 85% by 2023. 

        However, professional-grade drones, which in 2018 only represented approximately 13,000 aircraft, are expected to rapidly expand in market presence.

        When you embark on an endeavor within an industry that is highly regulated, a basic understanding of the history and present role of this regulatory body is vital to your success.  

        What its purpose is and how the FAA has historically operated, is crucial to understanding how to navigate through their present bureaucracy, which can be the difference between success and failure for commercial UAS providers.

        In 1966, Congress authorized the creation of a cabinet department that would combine major federal transportation responsibilities. This new Department of Transportation or DOT began full operations on April l, 1967. 

        On that day, the existing Federal Aviation Agency became one of several modal organizations within DOT and received a new name, the Federal Aviation Administration or FAA.

        The FAA has historically had to balance between promoting civil aviation and regulating and enforcing it to promote safety.  Your involvement will primarily be with complying with operational regulations and engaging with FAA inspectors.  

        Inspectors have been very accommodating in helping operators professionally navigate the complexities of the industry.  Having said that, their primary role is to ensure safety.

        Learn about airports and how they are categorized by the FAA. Airports influence the classification of airspace, so a good grasp of this knowledge is essential for safe and authorized drone operations. 

        Airports, along with the airspace and air traffic control facilities, constitute the National Airspace System or NAS. This ecosystem of assets, personnel and regulations forms one of the most complex aviation systems in the world.

  utter_step1_8_1:
    - text: |+
        The National Airspace System, or the NAS, provides pilots with various standard procedures that must be meticulously followed to execute any flight plan with a high degree of compliance.

        In regard to this, we will study airspace classification, operating requirements and potential flight restrictions imposed by external factors.

        Having a working knowledge of the NAS is vital in ensuring no violations of federal stipulations occur, neither before, during or after drone deployment.

        From this lesson you will be able to determine the classification of any airspace, based on its location relative to airports and its altitude relative to the ground and sea level.

        Being able to successfully identify the class of airspace in which a pilot is to deploy a drone is imperative, as to be aware of the exact requirements and restrictions placed upon drone 

        deployment within that area and avoid unnecessary safety risks.

        Finally, we will briefly present the concept of uncontrolled and special use airspace, discussing their determining factors and what concerns a pilot must have when planning to execute a flight plan within these areas.

        The Chart Supplement U.S. (formerly Airport/Facility Directory) provides the most comprehensive information available on a given airport. It contains information on airports, heliports, and seaplane bases that are open to the public. 

        The Chart Supplement U.S. is published in seven books, which are organized by regions and revised every 56 days. The Chart Supplement U.S. is also available digitally on the FAA website. 

        Critical information, which is of a temporary nature or not sufficiently known in advance to permit publication, is disseminated through the NOTAM system. 

        NOTAMs contain information such as taxiway and runway closures, construction, communications, changes in status of navigational aids and other information essential to en-route, terminal, or landing operations and which a UAV pilot can use to support their decision-making process regarding when and where to fly.

        The Automated Terminal Information Service (ATIS) is a recording of the local weather conditions and other pertinent non-control information, that is broadcast on a local frequency in a looped format.
        
        It is normally updated once per hour but is updated more often when changing conditions warrant it.

        UAV flight operations that are to be conducted within line of sight and below 400 feet above ground level are guided by Visual Flight Rules, or VFR, as to be in accordance with the National Airspace System. 

        VFR Flight Rules govern the FAA’s “see and avoid” mandate, regarding obstacles such as people, terrain, manmade structures and other airborne vehicles, be them manned or not.  

        They also impose strict visibility requirements for daylight operations, which vary according to the National Airspace Classification.

        By analyzing both the airspace class and environmental conditions a pilot is able to correctly identify which stipulations the NAS has placed on drone deployment. 

        Each Airspace Classification has its own visibility rules, though the majority of line of sight and below 400 feet AGL operations are conducted in Class G airspace.

        As commercial drones scale up in size, the pinnacle of applications is, of course passenger transport. If a drone can be used to commute, there would be no more traffic jams, construction delays and rush hour mayhem.

        Point-to-point autonomous aviation is poised to take off – and it will change the way we think about aviation. It will also change the way we move around and impact future urban planning strategies.

        There are over a dozen passenger drone manufacturers around the world at present. With a variety of design approaches, a number of models have been put to use in the real world.

        A popular application is short distance hops in high-density urban areas. These so-called ‘air taxis’ are now appearing within increasing frequency in cities across the world.

        It consists of associated information, services, rules, regulations, policies, procedures, personnel and equipment, including components shared jointly with the military.

        The National Airspace System (NAS) is formed by the airspace, navigation facilities and airports of the United States, being jointly managed by the FAA and the DoD.

        As a UAV Pilot, you are required to have a working knowledge of how to operate safely while being in compliance with the Federal rules governing airports and the National Airspace System.

        Drone flight operations for line of sight and below 400’ AGL, in the National Airspace System, are conducted by Visual Flight Rules (VFR), which govern the FAA’s “see and avoid” mandate regarding obstacles such as people, terrain, manmade structures and other airborne vehicles.

        Besides a preflight inspection of the UAV, all persons directly participating in the operation should be informed on operating conditions, emergency and contingency procedures and potential hazards.

        It is advisable to maintain both a hardcopy and an electronic log of all periodic inspections, maintenance, repairs and alterations, as to have them readily available for FAA inspection.

        Weather reporting and prediction, along with defined and accurate procedures, can greatly influence performance and safety. Combined and properly utilized, they will enhance the measure of your success.

        In this module, you’ll learn how to access aviation weather reports and forecasts, examine and interpret the data they provide, and apply the information to your flight planning and operations. 

        You’ll also explore proven industry procedures, from pre-flight inspections and maintenance, to in-flight emergencies and radio communications, which will help broaden your understanding of how your UAS operation fits into the overall aviation ecosystem.

        First of all, it’s important to understand that the term “weather service” describes the collective information provided from a group of entities - specifically the National Weather Service, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Department of Defense, and other aviation groups and individual data sources.

        Weather reports are those that describe the current conditions in a specific area, while weather forecasts are focused upon short to mid-term predictions for future weather.

        One of the most relevant weather reports are Meteorological Aerodrome Reports, also known as METARs. These put forth the present environmental conditions in the vicinity of a particular airport, providing detailed information on factors such as wind, visibility, cloud clearance and temperature.

        We’ve studied how adverse weather can affect the performance of a drone as well as overall operations.  And as we’ve seen in this video, there are many sources of weather information available to provide you with the necessary tools to assess atmospheric conditions before flight.

        As a drone pilot, you’ll need to check the METAR report and TAF forecasts prior to each flight.  By observing what the weather was, is, and will be, you can properly prepare for each mission.  

        We’ll examine these reports and forecasts in closer detail so you can start to become familiar with their use and applicability.

        In our next segment, we’ll take a look at three types of procedures that can help ensure safe operation of your drone.

        A remote pilot in command is required to perform checks of the unmanned aircraft prior to each flight to determine if it is safe for operation. 

        This section provides guidance on how to inspect and maintain an Unmanned Aircraft System. 

        Please note: This information can also be found in FAA Advisory Circular 107-dash-2, which is part of the larger FAA regulations we will explore in a future module.

        METAR is a weather report for a particular airport.  The METAR is designed to provide accurate depictions of current weather conditions. METAR is an abbreviation for Meteorological Aerodrome Report.

        TAF is a forecast of expected weather for the five-statute-mile radius around an airport.  It is an abbreviation for Terminal Aerodrome Forecast.

        A METAR is an observation of current surface weather reported in a standard international format. METARs are issued on a regularly scheduled basis unless significant weather changes have occurred.
        
        A special METAR (SPECI) can be issued at any time between routine METAR reports. 

        Type of report: There are two types of METAR reports. The first is the routine METAR report, which is transmitted on a regular time interval.

        The second is the aviation selected SPECI. This is a special report that can be given at any time to update the METAR for rapidly changing weather conditions, aircraft mishaps, or other critical information.

        More than likely, a routine METAR report is displayed.

        The Weather Service represents a vast global network that includes the National Weather Service, Federal Aviation Administration, Department of Defense, various aviation groups, and foreign weather organizations. 

        Collective data from these sources provides a comprehensive view of existing and forecasted weather conditions that remote pilots can use when planning drone operations.

        METARs build on a collection of continuous, up-to-date weather information called Surface Aviation Weather Observations.

        Surface observations provide local weather conditions and other relevant information for a specific airport. 

        This information can come from individual ground stations, government or private weather facilities, automated systems, and individuals.

        Airspace is categorized as regulatory or non-regulatory by the FAA. Within these two groups, there are four types of airspace, determined by aircraft density, location, operational significance and other considerations. 

        A range of advisories are applicable for each type of airspace. In this lesson, you’ll learn about the different FAA advisories across the National Airspace, and how they impact drone operations. 

  utter_step1_10_1:

        Also known as aerostats, lighter-than-air aircraft rely on buoyant gas (either heated air, or gases with lower density than air) to fly.

        By contrast, drones fall into the category of aerodynes — which rely on the movement of a wing surface through the surrounding air mass to fly. 

        Common examples of aerostats include hot-air balloons, powered airships, and hybrid types.

        Hot-air balloons operate by means of a heated air bag (the “envelope”), and can carry passengers or freight using an open or closed container suspended beneath the balloon.

        Hot-air balloons can be tethered or can drift with the wind but generally can’t be steered.

        These lighter-than-air craft come in a variety of shapes, can be used recreationally or commercially, and have even been used for military purposes.

        Although Part 107 covers most of the regulations for your drone business, you’ll need to refer to a few other sections of the Code for important information on related topics. Some of these topics include: 

        Part 48: Registration and Marking Requirements for Small Unmanned Aircraft

        Part 61: Certification of Pilots, Flight Instructors and Ground Instructors

        Part 91: General Operating and Flight Rules

        You’ll also want to note a few areas outside of Part 107 that are relevant to your drone business. For example:

        Regulations for operating drones over 55 pounds used to be in Part 333 of the FARs but that section is no longer valid. It’s been replaced by Exemption 44807.

        Also, Part 107 does not govern the use of drones for crop spraying.

        For Agricultural Aircraft Operations, you’ll need to refer to 14 CFR Part 137 to learn the requirements and how to get special certification to use your drone for this purpose.

        There’s no question that drones are changing the world of aviation. Permissions are expanding to allow more unmanned aircraft in the national airspace and managing all that air traffic is going to be key in safety and scalability.

        Remote Identification (or, Remote ID) is one way the FAA can ensure that this integration happens smoothly.

        Remote ID enables the FAA, law enforcement, and the Federal security agencies to act quickly and effectively when a drone flies unsafely or approaches a restricted area.

        Remote ID also helps identify unauthorized drones that could pose a security threat. 

        According to the FAA, Remote ID is the next step to enable safe routine drone operations across our nation.

        In the previous three segments, we presented general overviews of the FARs, both as they relate to various types of flight activities and as they relate to drones. We also explored the latest developments with Remote ID. 

        In this segment, we’ll unpack some selected regulations that are most relevant to your drone business and that are likely to be included on your FAA Part 107 exam. 

        (a) A remote pilot in command, owner, or person manipulating the flight controls of a small unmanned aircraft system must, upon request, make available to the Administrator:

        The remote pilot certificate with a small UAS rating; and

        Any other document, record, or report required to be kept under the regulations of this chapter.

        (b) The remote pilot in command, visual observer, owner, operator, or person manipulating the flight controls of a small unmanned aircraft system must, upon request, allow the Administrator to make any test or inspection of the small unmanned aircraft system, the remote pilot in command, the person manipulating the flight controls of a small unmanned aircraft system, and, if applicable, the visual observer to determine compliance with this part.

        The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is the main governing authority for all aviation activities in the United States, including not only drone operations, but all types of manned and unmanned aircraft.

        From pilot training and certification to aircraft design, operations and maintenance, the FARs are designed to ensure safety for everyone involved.

        FAA Part 107 contains the rules for operating a drone commercially in the United States. But other parts also contain critical information.

        Part 48 covers registration and marking requirements for small unmanned aircraft; Part 61 covers certification for pilots, flight instructors and ground instructors; Part 91 addresses general operating and flight rules; and Part 99 contains special security instructions. 

        Safety Alerts for Operators (SAFOs) provide time-sensitive safety information and recommendations to the aviation community and should be reviewed frequently.

        Flight Standards Information Management System (FSIMS) 8900.1 is a directive that aviation safety inspectors use as the system of record for all flight standards policy and guidance.

        And finally, Advisory Circulars (ACs) contain supplemental compliance guidance for Title 14 CFR regulations.

        The thrust of this course concerning Part 107 and the FAA exam is to emphasize the main body of the Part 107 rules and regulations.  

        Part 107.200 lists the “waiver policy and requirements” and Part 107.205 provides the “list of regulations subject to waiver.”

        Please remember a waiver cannot be applied to every regulation and the process for obtaining one varies in time and scope.

        Please remember to provide ample time to study before your exam.  This Flight to the Future course will more than prepare you with the material you need to pass.

        However, if you rush to take the exam before being prepared, you will be required to wait fourteen calendar days before you may reapply (reference 107.71).

        Number 1:   What type of military flight operations should a pilot expect along IR644 in the Devil’s Lake West MOA?


        A) IFR training flights above 1,500 feet AGL at speeds in excess of 250 knots.

        B) VFR training flights above 1,500 feet AGL at speeds less than 250 knots.

        C) Instrument training flights below 1,500 feet AGL at speeds in excess of 150 knots.

        A Military Training Route (MTR) is used by the military for conducting low-altitude, high-speed flight training.

        Typically, the routes above 1,500 ft. AGL are flown under instrument flight rules (IFR), and the routes flown under 1,500 ft. AGL are flown under visual flight rules (VFR).

        On a sectional chart, MTRs are identified as IFR (IR) and VFR (VR), followed by a number. All of this information is displayed on a straight line, with an arrow.

        MTRs with four numbers denote routes flown at 1,500 ft. AGL and below. At such a low altitude, this can present challenges to an unmanned aircraft.

        MTRs with three numbers denote routes flown with at least one segment above 1,500 ft.

        c.  When the aircraft has a takeoff weight that is more than 0.55 pounds, but less than 55 pounds, not including the fuel and necessary attachments

        2.  	A small UA causes an accident and your crew member loses consciousness.  When do you report the accident?

        a. No accidents need to be reported
        b. When requested by the UA owner
        c. Within 10 days of the accident.

        3.	According to 14 CFR part 48, when must a person register a small UA with the FAA?

          a.  Only when the operator will be paid for commercial services
          b.  When the small UA is used for any purpose other than as a model aircraft
          c.  All civilian small UAS weighing greater than 0.55 pounds must be registered regardless of its intended use

        Imagine an ecosystem specially designed for drones.
        
        The third decade of the 21st. century will see great advances in the UAV industry. A confluence of technologies has made it possible to envision and develop a connected, scalable model for the industry, where all concerned parties have a port of call. UAV pilot training and education, flight control and pilot experiences, operations management, real-time data analysis and intelligent maintenance processes are some of the salient entry points in this ecosystem.
        As we alluded to earlier, the hallmark of this ecosystem is the cloud.
        
        Aquiline Drones has set up a specialized, hybrid cloud tailored for anything and everything related to drones. An ever-evolving framework, the AD Cloud is powering key service platforms that cater to UAVs and UAS providers. The Flight to the Future is one of these highly integrated services, where future UAS providers can get the necessary education and prepare for their professional journey. Another crucial service is the AD Command and Control or C2 module.
        C2 provides total UAV operations management with FAA compliance.
        
        The C2 dashboard is a one-stop shop for UAS business owners, operations managers and even pilots themselves. It is ideal for both a single UAV operator or a very large enterprise with thousands of pilots and aircraft. FAA compliance ensures proper UAV integration into the National Airspace. Precise operations planning and mission setup, along with cloud connectivity to the hardware ensures easy and scalable UAV deployments. 
        
        The C2 environment will sync up with the pilot dashboard in the larger ecosystem and will be FAA LAANC enabled. We'll take a closer look at the C2 environment in later lessons.
        
        Then, of course, is the all-important pilot experience. An android based dashboard provides advanced flight planning and piloting controls. It is in sync with the C2 dashboard, so there is a single version of the truth for pilots and operations managers alike. The C2 Pilot dashboard will be included with an AD cloud-connected drone. 
        UAV operations are planned and executed using a precise collaboration of capabilities between the C2 and C2 Pilot service platforms. The C2 dashboard is available on the browser and requires Internet connectivity to work. The C2 Pilot app is designed for on-site operations and requires LTE connectivity to sync with the main C2 platform. 
        
        However, in the absence of LTE signals, missions can still be flown by pilots using the controller wi-fi network with no loss of flight or data gathering capability. In this case, real-time data transmission will be downgraded to post-mission data uploads.
        
        Another important piece of this ecosystem is a revolutionary service platform, Aquiline's Drone-on-Demand or ADoD. This is an app with commercial UAV opportunity listings available on a first-come first-served basis for certain AD Cloud account holders, including Flight to the Future subscribers. The ADoD service will post UAV job opportunities that can be accepted by authorized providers. The framework works closely with the C2 and C2 Pilot platforms to make the workflow a seamless process – from acceptance to job completion. ADoD will also feature customer reviews and UAS provider ratings.
        
        All these service platforms are part of AD's Total Planetary Protection or TPP initiative. Although focused on UAVs at present, TPP is a larger “smart planet” initiative that endeavors to bring together cloud technologies, the Internet of Things, AI for machine automation and data analysis under the AD Cloud umbrella. The ultimate goal is to get machines of different capabilities to collaborate and solve increasingly complex problems.
        
        In step 2 of your journey, you'll discover all the key technologies that are making this convergence possible. Once you have the concepts in hand, you'll get introduced to UAV operations planning and discover the power of the C2 dashboard.
        
        This educational experience will familiarize you with core ideas like operations, missions, flights and, of course, aircraft – from the perspective of business practicality, scalability and FAA compliance. 
        
        The ecosystem described here, is unprecedented in nature and doesn't exist at present. As Flight to the Future participants, you'll be the first to experience the power of full life cycle cloud connectivity in drone operations. New capabilities are already being planned for future evolutions and services like ADoD are just the tip of the iceberg. 
        
        Are you ready to continue your journey into the aviation future? Let's go!

          As a whole, the Internet of Things is a huge industry, currently estimated at over seven trillion dollars in market value. So, let's take a closer look at what an IoT is and why it's making such a disruptive impact.

          This modern-day technological revolution, which is transforming how we do things in a myriad of ways, is driven by forming a network of devices using embedded electronics and wireless connectivity.

          The first component is embedded electronics. These work in tandem with cloud connectivity to make IoT possible. The key aspect is the devices themselves, which establish secure communications with an Internet of Things platform, that is able to integrate and analyze data from multiple devices. This platform is the second component of an IoT.

          IoT technology allows organizations to collect a trove of valuable information, execute industry-leading analytics, obtain real-time insights and make timely decisions.

          Let's look at a smart building. Sensors throughout the building allow for a complete set of relevant data to be analyzed in a centralized fashion, allowing for energy cost savings, improving occupant experiences and maximizing space utilization.

        The most recent revolution in the UAV industry has been the application of cloud connectivity to enable IoT behavior, which has continuously provided exciting new applications and gains in efficiency, in a global economy that is increasingly powered by automated technologies. 

        With AI, cloud and edge computing, data from the drones can be analyzed to generate actionable information. Let's take a closer look at both the connectivity and analysis stages in detail.

        As we saw earlier, cloud connected drones are essentially IoT devices, being deployed with advanced sensor and connectivity capabilities. "Intelligence" may be cloud driven or on-board.

        Most of the internet infrastructure was designed specifically for human interaction. However, machines operate at much higher interaction speeds than we do.

        Tackling big data with scalability

        Cloud connectivity opens the door to a large-scale UAV management platform. An IoT framework allows for the drones to also talk to one another, enabling more complex operations with increased automation and efficiency.

        Data analysis during in-flight intervals and after the mission requires powerful algorithms, tailored for different use case. AI enabled tools hold the greatest potential for leveraging drone data into actionable intelligence.

        An artificial neural network or ANN is a system of computing that loosely resembles neural networks in animal brains. It learns to perform tasks by looking at examples, rather than using a pre-determined set of coded instructions.

        Deep Learning is based on ANNs and is part of a larger family of Machine Learning. Here, the neurons of an ANN are distributed in layers, which gives the name "deep".

        ANNs solve problems progressively. For example, one layer of neurons may identify the edges of an image. A different layer of neurons is geared to recognize more advanced image characteristics such as people.
        
        Since Deep Learning networks learn by example, they can be trained to solve certain types of problems with increasing accuracy over time. This introduces the notion of a skill.

        Deep Learning techniques are applied to a range of AI frameworks, including Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, speech recognition, bioinformatics, asset inspection and autonomous vehicle control. 

        Spartacus combines FAA and third-party data sources such as weather to provide pilots with informed advisories. This is done through the Command and Control (C2) platform on AD Cloud. 

        Be prepared for a rich experience when a Deep Learning artificial intelligence is your companion in an educational journey. Online educational experiences can greatly benefit with the use of AI.

      The Internet of Things or IoT is a physical network of devices - machines, sensors and so forth that are embedded with electronics that enable Internet connectivity. 

      The first component is embedded electronics in devices, which enable secure and usually wireless communications with an Internet of Things platform. 

      IoT systems obtain vast volumes of data that, when analyzed, generate valuable insights, automated responses, real-time metrics and even new revenue streams.

      With an estimated market value of seven trillion dollars it is clear that organizations are already making investments into cutting-edge IoT systems. Many commercial and industrial applications already exist.

      UAVs equipped with IoT technology are a powerful tool to be leveraged by businesses, being capable of performing complex monitoring activities and executing automated tasks.

      The speed with which data is transmitted and processed is critical for real-time, high-volume data systems, such as IoT. To reduce latency, edge computing places processing infrastructure as close as possible to where the data is generated.

      Spartacus is the avatar for a modular cognitive system used by the AD Cloud to extract deep insights, often in real-time, from asset, operational and external data sources.

      Spartacus can learn application-specific skills and it is a Deep Learning artificial intelligence, playing a crucial role in optimizing UAV operations within AD's Command and Control platform for drone management.

      A specialized hybrid cloud is a central component of the modern UAV ecosystem. Such a system requires three main elements:

      Low latency edge computing

      High bandwidth mobility

      Sophisticated dynamic IoT firmware

      AD Cloud possesses a robust security and authentication framework, integrated across the infrastructure elements.

      AD's modular cloud design structure allows for great scalability in high density drone operations, across industries. These services can be added 'a la carte', tailored to both small and large business needs.

      AD Cloud is designed with a full range of core service platforms that tend to the ever-growing UAV industry needs, such as training and education, mission control, data analysis, maintenance and a unique Drone-on-Demand offering.

      The C2 platform is specialized in leveraging all types of mission data. Storage, real-time streaming and integrated analytics provide on-demand value to UAS providers, with features available as add-ons for specific applications.

      Driven by OpenStack, which is a set of open source software components, the cloud layer will allow for an Infrastructure as a Service or IaaS model. 

  utter_step2_4_2:

      A computer network has low latency when it is optimized to process a high volume of data messages with minimal delay or latency. By providing computing environments outside a centralized architecture, UAV data transfers and processing can occur on the edge as needed, dramatically increasing efficiency and improving business outcomes.

      High bandwidth mobility is another important element. In general, high performance clouds consume high bandwidths. However, it's not just a matter of large data pipes. The cloud architecture needs to be efficient in design.

      Firmware is any code running on hardware that is critical to the hardware's operation. With firmware, IoT devices are able to process information and take actions. Firmware was traditionally hard to update, hence the “firm” in the designation.

      At its core, the cloud should provide Infrastructure-as-a-Service or IaaS using virtualization technology. This allows the decoupling of the physical infrastructure from the logical, such as networking, compute resources and storage. 

      Object storage breaks up data files into pieces called objects. The objects are stored in a single repository, which is usually distributed across multiple networked systems. Applications then manage all of the objects they need, each with a unique identification, which eliminates the need for a traditional file storage system. 

      Finally, as mentioned before, edge capabilities are very useful and perhaps even crucial, when dealing with drones. By designing the cloud architecture to better handle edge computing needs, we can bring unprecedented reliability in UAV operations and traffic management.

      Scalability for high density drone operations across industries requires a modular cloud design. AD Cloud services can be added "a la carte" - allowing businesses to start small, then scale up as needed.

      Before we delve into the specifics of the core modules, let's examine some of the benefits that the AD Cloud brings to UAS providers. Broadly speaking, it brings:

      UAV specific features

      Aviation compliance

      Automated operations

      Data insights

      Full lifecycle governance

      It's important for a cloud environment to cater to the industry it's being utilized for. Specialized capabilities and algorithms for UAV operations, manufacturing and MRO make AD Cloud a desirable choice for UAS providers.

      The AD Cloud provides connectivity and insights across the lifecycle of drones - from product development to manufacturing to UAV operations and MRO. This results in vastly greater efficiencies and reduced downtime.

      Services tailored for UAS providers will be driven by cloud connectivity and computing. As this model becomes widespread, it will pave the way for large-scale and automated drone operations.

      The C2 or Command and Control service platform is AD's framework for planning, deploying and managing commercial UAV operations. This cloud-driven platform is composed of the C2 operations dashboard and the C2 Pilot app. 

      AD's Command and Control module divides operational planning and execution into a three-tiered environment, consisting of operations, missions and flights.

      The C2 dashboard is cloud connected and meant for remote operations leads and managers. A key environment within the C2 dashboard is the asset management view, where an operations lead can efficiently manage, track and allocate mission critical assets, such as pilots, aircraft, sensors, payloads and batteries. 

      In addition to the live streamed data, there is the raw data from the drone sensor. This data is manually downloaded from the drone after the flight is complete and the C2 dashboard provides a means to identify and upload the information seamlessly. In many cases, this would be very high-quality video files. 
      
      However, as we'll see in later modules, depending on the sensor, the data output can vary. For example LiDAR data is stored in raw formats which then require additional processing to convert to 3D point cloud models.

      Executing UAV missions within complex airspace, that have multiple restrictions and requirements to obtain flight authorizations, can be extremely challenging for drone service providers.

  utter_step2_5_2:

      The C2 platform is the backbone of your daily UAV operations, allowing for mission planning, flight execution, and post-mission data handling, with enhanced efficiency and optimized workflows. As future releases of data analytics modules become available, the C2 platform can manage your workflow cycle from planning to customer delivery of services.
      
      AD Command and Control is a comprehensive service platform for mission planning and execution which allows for integration between UAV business owners, operators, and pilots. It is divided into two main parts, the C2 dashboard, and the C2 pilot app.
      
      The asset management section is designed to facilitate the oversight of personnel and equipment such as drones, batteries, and specific payloads.
      
      The C2 environment defines an operation as an area on the map. This is the starting point when a new customer requires any type of drone service. Within the operations section of the C2 platform, you can view all current operations as well as set up new ones. A detailed description of each operation is provided, including description, location, end goals and so on.

      A mission is created when you add a date, time and Pilot in Command to an operation. For the sake of scalability, an operation can have many missions. This allows for a team of drones to take the field simultaneously, while also allowing for periodic flights over the same area. 
      
      C2 enables UAV service providers to optimize procedures, with intelligent tools that offer full-scope operations management capabilities, facilitated mission and flight supervision, and real-time insights into flight data. 

  utter_step2_5_3:
    -text: |
    
      The asset management dashboard enables UAV service operators to add personnel, aircraft, batteries, and payloads to their asset pool. This process is simple and straightforward so that the allocation of mission-critical assets can be effortlessly executed by operations managers.
      
      Your UAV business receives a job request to do a property land survey on a farm. This request is processed by a back-office team, detailed in a standard intake document format, and sent to the operations manager. The format of this document should reflect the parameters that a C2 operation needs defined in the framework.

      Flights can have a flight plan or be manual. They can be part of mission or be orphan flights. Orphan flights are useful if it's a 'one-off' flight or if it's some sort of a test flight that doesn't need to add clutter on the C2 dashboard.

      Regarding flight plans, flights can be fully automated by the creation of flight paths or can be deployed manually when a pilot intends to operate the drone themselves. During the flight, the actCritical details are displayed in the C2 dashboard, organized across operations and missions. The on-field portion, with emphasis on flights, is synced with the C2 Pilot environment.ive view provides real-time video and telemetry data for active missions.

      Planning missions in complex airspace requires meticulous groundwork, especially when dealing with a range of restrictions and advisories due to multiple types of airspace.

      In the C2 module, users first determine operational areas on the map, which informs them of any restrictions or necessary authorizations within the operation's area.
      
      There are six main classes of airspace, from A to G, each with corresponding restrictions, which are based upon factors such as proximity to airports or military installations.
      
      While most airspace is open and does not require specific authorizations for drone flight, restricted or controlled airspace requires approval for drone flights. Some authorizations are LAANC enabled, meaning they can be obtained automatically within the C2 module.
      
      With the drone operation being divided into three separate missions based on airspace type, each mission will be processed according to its specific authorization requirements.

      When setting up missions for an operation based on different airspace or authorization types, operations managers can assign pilots with different levels of experience to each mission.
      
      A pilot would be sent to the unrestricted mission in free airspace, while a second, more experienced pilot can be allocated to the controlled airspace mission, and a senior PIC can be selected for the mission within restricted airspace.

      The Command and Control or C2 platform is AD's mission management tool, enabling collaboration between operators, pilots and crew. It includes the C2 dashboard and the C2 Pilot app.

      The C2 module assists commercial drone operators every step of the way, with activities such as real-time monitoring, flight planning, automation and more, using user-friendly tools.
      
      An operation is an area defined on the US map in the C2 dashboard, which is FAA compliant and integrates NAS data to provide operations managers with clear insights regarding airspace restrictions.
      
      A mission is an operation with a pilot and time stamp. It is the geographical area of operations, along with a certified PIC, and a time interval during which the mission will occur.
      
      A flight is conducted when a drone takes to the air and is defined by adding a flight plan and aircraft to a mission. The flight plan can be for either a manual or an autonomous flight.

      Any necessary FAA authorizations are issued on a mission-to-mission basis. Most missions may not ever need any authorization, but some do. Authorizations can be LAANC or manual in nature. 
      
      The active view is an environment where operations managers and UAV business owners can monitor real-time data for all ongoing flights, such as location, altitude, speed, flight time, and battery charge. 

      The C2 platform enables optimized post-flight data handling, by storing all completed flight data, such as telemetry and video feeds, allowing easy access to the core customer deliverables. 
      
      There are different types of airspace, each with specific restrictions and authorization requirements. In areas that overlap multiple airspace types, the C2 platform will advise users to break up the operation into individual missions.

      Asset management is a crucial part of running a commercial drone business, as different types of resources such as personnel, aircraft, batteries and payloads are utilized in daily operations.
      
      Managing a competent workforce is vital to commercial success in the UAV industry, with a range of key roles being required to deliver high-end drone services.
      
      Pilots and managers alike, can manage total airtime, number of flights, geographic locations and payload compatibilities. The outcome is efficient allocation of valuable equipment and predictive maintenance. 

      This is the main PIC experience for operators using AD Cloud connected drones. From a flight execution perspective, the C2 Pilot app is needed for integrating drones into the C2 platform and carrying out deployments in the field.  The app connects to a drone's controller and to the drone directly, while also relaying drone sensor data to the AD Cloud.

      Once a flight is completed, all streamed telemetry and sensor data is permanently stored on the cloud. Raw sensor files can also be manually uploaded in the 'Archive' after the drone has landed. These are traditionally the deliverable a customer pays for.
      
      Digital twins are virtual replicas of physical objects or systems and are defined by real-time sensor data from the physical version.

      UAV operations rely heavily on assets to function and perform well, and to deliver high-quality services to their clients. Therefore, optimally managing operational assets is an integral part of guaranteeing a successful drone business. 

      Commercial drone businesses possess physical, human, and intellectual assets that require managing. From personnel to payloads, the C2 platform enables UAV service providers to comprehensively administer both human and equipment resources throughout the entire asset and project life cycle.

      Managing people is one of the largest challenges any drone service provider must face. Each person within the organization has their part to play in delivering professional UAV services.
    
      For PICs, it is vital to reference their FAA Part 107 certification number along with a phone contact, specifically for regulatory compliance purposes. This allows C2 to automatically request and obtain any necessary flight authorizations for the PIC. As seen earlier, this is done by defining a mission in the C2 platform.
      
      The most crucial physical asset for any drone operator is most definitely the aircraft itself, with C2 providing business owners a reliable way to manage their fleet through full data integration and connectivity. 
      
      Payloads are a core part of commercial drone deployment, and without them, it is impossible to execute any job. Therefore, a well-executed payload management process is essential to any drone business. 

  utter_step2_6_3:
    -text: |

      The first step is to use the C2 Pilot app to connect with a ground station. A ground station is the drone's controller, which can be connected to the C2 app via a wi-fi hotspot or USB tether.
      
      In the C2 pilot app, flight creation is made simple and straightforward. It offers full integration with the C2 dashboard, synchronizing all flight details, and pushes information onto the platform for management oversight.

      Once basic information has been provided, the flight details view will show all the flight data, such as aircraft details, mission date, time, and location. If the flight is part of a C2 mission, the app will also provide with the status of all pertaining FAA authorizations and multiple weather forecasts for the location where the flight is set to take place.

      A considerable advantage of the full connectivity that the C2 module provides is the real-time video and telemetry feeds from the drone to the cohort. In the case of the on-field PIC and crew, this is the active view of the drone when it's in an active flight. 

      The consolidation of critical data within the active view allows for any deviations from flight plans or potential risks to be promptly identified and mitigated. The value provided for the operations management teams is immeasurable, considering how it facilitates the monitoring of increasing volumes of active drone flights, no matter how geographically dispersed they might be.

      Once flights have been completed, an 'Archive' button becomes available on the flight details view. All cloud streamed telemetry and video logs are automatically stored on the cloud and accessible from here. 

      The C2 Pilot app is highly customizable and can be configured to the specific needs of each mission and flight. This procedure is done through the 'Settings' section in the app, where the PIC can determine the parameters to suit each mission's needs.

      A digital twin is a digital replica of a physical object or system that can span its full life cycle and is continuously updated with real-time data, allowing for advanced simulations that assist critical decision-making processes.

      Digital twins provide businesses with unprecedented insights into product performance throughout the life cycle, assisting in the identification of potential faults, enabling remote troubleshooting and ultimately improving overall customer satisfaction. 

      It is essential for operators to not only understand how assets are performing at present, but also be able to provide engineers with data that can help adjust and optimize designs accordingly. 
      
      IoT devices allow engineers to obtain an uninterrupted flow of data throughout all stages of an asset's life cycle, by continuously updating parameters related to health and performance indicators.
      
      Digital twins can be successfully utilized as an innovation platform for prototyping physical assets, with the twin providing engineering feedback as the design is continuously tweaked and refined – before any physical version is built. 
      
      Digital twins allow for the decentralization of operations teams, who may now access reliable digital models instead of having to perform manual inspections of physical assets, which enhances operational efficiency and reduces project turnaround time.

      Once drone obtained data is bound to a virtual counterpart, a digital construct can then be established to support asset management activities, especially within industries that possess large-scale, remote or complex assets.

      Commercial drone businesses rely heavily on both human and physical assets for operational success. The C2 platform provides centralized asset management for mission critical resources.

      The C2 platform allows you to add personnel to your organization, and assign roles which include owner, PIC, flight planner, auxiliary crew, visual observer, dispatcher, cargo or sensor specialist, and inspector.

      The C2 platform empowers business operators to manage a widespread fleet of drones by monitoring real-time locations and multiple status indicators. Drones are added once they are paired with the C2 Pilot app.

      The larger the scale of drone operations, the more critical effective battery management becomes. Complex missions require well thought-out battery calculations and disciplined on-field management to succeed. 

      Payloads are an essential part of every commercial drone mission. It could be an object the drone is required to deliver, or an active or passive sensor that is responsible for obtaining data or interacting with the environment. 
      
      PICs can create new flights as part of a specific mission, or as an orphan flight. On the flight details view, users are provided with key mission information, such as date, time, location, weather forecasts and the status of any FAA authorizations.

      A digital twin is a virtual model of a physical object or system. It is built by integrating large quantities of sensor data into a virtual representation, which then becomes a dynamic, data driven version of the original.

      For enterprise scale operations, digital twins can play a crucial role in driving predictive maintenance, allowing operation leads to set up and manage a sophisticated fleet management effort.

      UAV market opportunities, Target Applications, Operation planning, AD solution framework and Transports as a service

      The market for UAV solutions is one of the fastest growing in the technology sector, with exponential growth expected over the next five years.

      The increasing complexity of drone solutions necessitates meticulous operational planning to ensure that you, as a UAV service provider, can complete successful missions while avoiding additional problems.

      However, to be cost-competitive in large-scale deployments, drones service providers must deliver highly scalable solutions.

      TaaS solutions, which allow the integration of numerous modes of transportation to deliver payloads in on-demand environments, are one of the primary growth areas in the UAV business.

      It is critical to set up sufficient time for detailed mission and flight planning so that all regulatory, resource, risk, and safety concerns may be handled.

      It begins with pre-operation planning. This is a must for any drone operator who desires to be well-prepared, deliver high-quality services and gain client trust.

      To be successful in commercial operations, you must be well-versed in the fundamental factors for good UAV mission planning.

      To begin, determine who or what group of persons has the authority to request, approve, plan, and deploy flying operations, as well as under what conditions they can do so.

      Drone pilots can seek for near-instant airspace authorization using a mobile or online application as part of the FAA Low Altitude Authorization and Notification Capability (LAANC) initiative.

      Drone flights can be set up in two different ways. It is either a manual setup, in which the flight path is laid out as a guide for the PIC, or an automated flight, in which the drone receives GPS data from the flight planner, which tells it where to go.

      LLC definition, Registering Your LLC Business, Federal and state tax requirements, Risk management and insurance

      A Limited Liability Company (LLC) is a corporate structure that is permitted by state law, according to the IRS. When it comes to registering a business, each state may have its own set of rules and fees.

      Every state's regulations mandate that new business names be distinct from those of existing businesses in that jurisdiction. That implies you can't pick a name that's the same as another business entity's or is only distinguishable by a "s" at the end or a different business entity identification. 

      A new LLC must file formation documents with the state and pay a filing fee. The state will impose a one-time fee as well as annual filing fees. These costs differ by state, so be sure to check your state's regulations.

      If your state requires it, you will receive a 1099 from AD for any income you received over the previous year, which you can use to file your federal and state taxes. We recommend that you seek advice from a tax specialist.

      Drone equipment, UAV sensors, Personnel requirements, Primary roles, A real-life example, MRO

      Drones are more formally known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or unmanned aircraft systems (UASes). Essentially, a drone is a flying robot that can be remotely controlled or fly autonomously through software-controlled flight plans in their embedded systems, working in conjunction with onboard sensors and GPS.

      Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul, or MRO, usually refers to FAA and manufacturer prescribed maintenance repair activities of various types and complexities. Here we will touch upon each of the processes that comprise MRO, as well as understanding insurance and liability.

      Active sensors are well active. They emit some type of wave or radiation.

      Passive sensors detect waves or radiation, receiving information as it is detected in the natural world. The main examples are eyes and ears

      LiDAR, or Light Detection and Ranging, technology resembles its sister technology, radar. But instead of emitting and analyzing radio waves, it produces and measures rapid laser pulses.

      Thermal sensors are able to accurately measure surface temperatures. Every object gives off a heat signature, and thermal sensors are able to translate that signal into a false color optical image

      It is important to keep in mind that as mission complexity increases, so does personnel requirements, and that a business focused on videography for social events has very different personnel requirements compared to one that conducts offshore platform inspections.
      
      The main roles generally employed by UAV service providers include:Owner, Pilot-in-Command, Operator, Visual observer, Sensor specialist etc.

      The owner could be a purchaser of the UAV or the overall UAV Operation, the LLC. The owner could also serve in other roles such as the Pilot in Command (PIC) and be an owner operator of the commercial drone business. The owner could also serve in an auxiliary crew capacity.

      The operator, who is a member of the auxiliary crew, may take control of the UAV under the direct supervision of the certified PIC. They must be well versed in the flight control of various UAV models and be briefed in detail on the planned flight path.

      A Visual Observer or VO is an optional crew member who serves as a second set of eyes, monitoring the drone during flight to provide support to the Pilot-in-Command. The Visual Observer must be able to see the UAV throughout the entirety of the mission and must always be in direct communication with both the PIC and operator.

      A sensor specialist is an operator who is trained to manipulate the sensor payloads that are required to execute mission objectives. Considering the wide set of applications that UAVs are now being deployed for, sometimes multiple specialists will be required for more complex solutions.

      Facilities: Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO)

      In aviation, the term Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) traditionally refers to FAA certified maintenance repair stations, with strict adherence to established federal regulations which govern their service, under 14 CFR Part 145.

      While Part 107.15 requires the remote PIC to ensure that the UAV is in condition for safe flight, both prior to and during its operation, it does not provide structured procedures by which to accomplish this.

      There may be components of a UAV that are identified by the manufacturer to undergo scheduled periodic maintenance or replacement based on time-in-service limits, such as flight hours, cycles, and calendar days.

      In our endeavor to model our AD ecosystem in alignment with aviation industry standards, we are taking established steps towards applying aviation-grade MRO practices to AD's product line.
      
      When a loaner aircraft is provided, the liability associated with the AD-owned loaner drone transfers automatically to the client once the loaner is paired to the AD Cloud.

      As missions get complex, so do the tools. Optimizing the right aircraft and sensors to an application use case is critical when planning for a drone mission.

      Active sensors emit some form of radiation or sound, and then detect the reflected signals. Examples include LiDAR, radar and sonar.

      Drones depend on specialized sensors like LiDAR, thermal, multi-spectral and spectroscopic instruments to inspect assets, analyze natural environments and gather scientific data.

      Hyperspectral sensors go deeper and are capable of creating three-dimensional imagery, such as within the forestry industry where UAVs are able to identify the exact species of certain trees.

      UAS providers must correctly identify the human resource requirements that will guarantee the successful implementation of client services, whether it be on-field or in the office.

      An operator can serve as a member of the auxiliary crew and may operate the controls of the UAV under the direct supervision of a certified Pilot in Command.
